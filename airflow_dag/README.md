wallpaper.py is a simple airflow DAG that updates the background slide show every day.

The slideshows are the different directories under ~/slides.

The slideshow is modified by editing the file ~/.local/share/shotwell/wallpaper/wallpaper.xml.

The other 2 python files were scripts used to test the basic code before creating the dag.
